        The <b>cat</b> (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.<sup>[1][2]</sup> It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the <b>domestic cat</b> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
        <sup>[4]</sup> A cat can either be a <b>house cat</b>, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.<sup>[5]</sup> Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.<sup>[6]</sup>
