        The <b>cat</b> (Felis catus) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domestic</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species">species</a> of small carnivorous mammal.<sup>[1][2]</sup> It is the only domesticated species in the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae#:~:text=Felidae%20(%2F%CB%88f%C9%9Bl,domestic%20cat%20(Felis%20catus).">Felidae</a> and is often referred to as the <b>domestic cat</b> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
        <sup>[4]</sup> A cat can either be a <b>house cat</b>, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.<sup>[5]</sup> Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent">rodents</a> . About 60 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cat_breeds">cat breeds</a> are recognized by various cat registries.<sup>[6]</sup>

        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflex">reflexes</a>, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_vision">night vision</a> and sense of smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meow">meowing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purr"> purring</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trill_consonant">trilling</a>, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals.<sup>[7]</sup> It secretes and perceives pheromones.<sup>[8]</sup>
